Huffman Coding for Optimal Compression 
1. Introduction:-

This project implements the Huffman Coding algorithm in C++ which shows the use of Greedy Algorithms for optimal, lossless data compression. The goal is to shorten the binary codes for characters that are more frequent while extending the codes for characters that are less frequent to minimize and compress the size of the data without loss.  

The code is of high advanced standards in respect to the complexity and quality of the code which demonstrates a strong approach to developing the algorithm.



2. Solution Design and Advanced Features:-

The focus within the solution gives equal consideration to achieving optimal implementation efficiency and ease of readability.  

The combination of advanced algorithms and the use of priority queues enabled the achievement of an O(NlogN) time complexity. There is advanced algorithms and the use of priority queues are the best testament to this.  

Respecting the design principles pertaining to Code Quality and Memory Safety, one of the high order visions in system design is demonstrated in the proactive memory management embodied in the Recursive Destructor (~HuffmanNode()), complete with memory management in C++. This is the sophisticated approach concerning the full tree structure when the program terminates. To manage the Min-Heap's definition during the greedy merging step, the system relies on Custom Data Structures for HuffmanNode and MinHeapCompare.  

The solutionâ€™s use of Analytics for advanced synthesis stands out as its Unique Feature. It comprises a distinct method that articulates the Total Bits Required and Average Code Length metrics, offering direct quantification on the compression efficacy of the algorithm as applied in practice. A consistent output stream makes this level of insight achievable.

3. How to Compile and Run:-

The program is self-contained in a single file and can be compiled and run from any standard terminal environment.
1. Compile the code using a modern C++ compiler (g++ or clang++):g++ -std=c++17 -o huffman_solver huffman_coding.cpp
2. Run the executable: The input data is hardcoded to the assignment example (S="abcdef" and f[]={5, 9, 12, 13, 16, 45})../huffman_solver
